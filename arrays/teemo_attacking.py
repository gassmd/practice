 495. Teemo Attacking
 https://leetcode.com/problems/teemo-attacking/
 Our hero Teemo is attacking an enemy Ashe with poison attacks! When Teemo attacks Ashe, Ashe gets poisoned for a exactly duration seconds.
 More formally, an attack at second t will mean Ashe is poisoned during the inclusive time interval [t, t + duration - 1].
 If Teemo attacks again before the poison effect ends, the timer for it is reset, and the poison effect will end duration seconds after the new attack.
 You are given a non-decreasing integer array timeSeries, where timeSeries[i] denotes that Teemo attacks Ashe at second timeSeries[i], and an integer duration.
 Return the total number of seconds that Ashe is poisoned.

Intuition
The problem is an example of merge interval questions which are now quite popular in Google
Typically such problems could be solved in a linear time in the case of sorted input, like here, and in O(Nlog‚Å°N)\mathcal{O}(N \log N)O(NlogN) time otherwise, here is an example.
Here one deals with a sorted input, and the problem could be solved in one pass with a constant space. The idea is straightforward: consider only the interval between two attacks. Ashe spends in a poisoned condition the whole time interval if this interval is shorter than the poisoning time duration duration, and duration otherwise.

Algorithm
Initiate total time in poisoned condition total = 0.
Iterate over timeSeries list. At each step add to the total time the minimum between interval length and the poisoning time duration duration.
Return total + duration to take the last attack into account.
